## Installation 
Tested on Windows 10 w/ Python-3.9 & Tensorflow-2.5, Ubuntu 20.02 w/ Python-3.8.10 & Tensorflow-2.5, & Windows 10 w/ Python-3.7.1 & Tensorflow-1.14.0  
Note: If you already have an environment with Tensorflow installed, it might be easiest to manually install `Numpy>=1.19.0`, `scikit-learn>=1.0`, and `scipy>=1.7.0`.  

### Pip Virtual Env.  
Make sure `virtualenv` is installed.

#### Create Environment

Windows:
