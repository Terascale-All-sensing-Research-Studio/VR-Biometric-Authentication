# VR-Biometric-Authentication
Biometric authentication work done at TARS lab.

## Authentication Directory
Code for training and testing Siamese networks to perform authentication based on subjects' behaviour.

## Dataset Directory
Links to download the recorded motions subjects made in VR and video recordings of the subject performing the task.
